_Oh no! The player is stuck inside a "loop"--that is, their inner tube--from a tragic inner-tubing accident that left them stuck in the bottom of an endless crevasse!_

This is an endless climber (2D platformer) game, with novel wall-bouncing mechanics!

_**Ludum Dare 47 Submission: https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/stuck-in-an-inner-tube/**_

This game is based off of a "Compo" submission for the [Ludum Dare 47 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/47/stuck-in-an-inner-tube/). You can see Levi's original submission version at https://github.com/levilindsey/tube-climber.

### The theme: "Stuck in a loop"

The theme for the game jam was "stuck in a loop". This game addresses the theme in two ways:
1.  The player is stuck inside a "loop"--that is, their inner tube--from a tragic inner-tubing accident.
2.  The vertically-scrolling level has no end, it "loops" through previous platforms if you get far enough.
